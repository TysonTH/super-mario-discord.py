Discord bot with some basic features written in Python

This was written with private use only in mind, so it does not have any security features in place that you would expect a public Discord bot to have.

This has not been tested on Windows so it assumes you will be running this under Debian Linux.

Requirements for the bot to run properly are:

`pip install python-dotenv`
`pip install discord.py`

You will also need to fill in the bot token and other information in the .env files stored in root and cog folders.

Sounds are also not provided as they are copyrighted material but a list of sounds the program expects is included.
